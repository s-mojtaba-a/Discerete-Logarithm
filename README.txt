It will give the smallest x for a^x = b (mod m).

a and m are not necessarily coprime.

The algorithm is baby-step giant-step with the time copmlexity of O(sqrt(m) lg m ). 

0^0 != 1.

In python, you should make a new object for solving each test case, otherwise you may get wrong answer or memory limit exeeded error
